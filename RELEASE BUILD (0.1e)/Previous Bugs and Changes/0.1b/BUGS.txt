BUGS (Arthur) (11/26/2016):
---------------------------

- make lock_id take a std::thread pointer?
	- taking an int for thread_id is a failure because the id is tied to
		code blocks, not to actual running threads.
- check barrier because it's terminating before nested threads finish
	- switch to waiting on reaper thread to finish?
		- UPDATE: reaper thread had an error on when it was noticing
				that there were no threads left to reap and was
				ending up in an infinite wait situation because of
				that error.
		- UPDATE: the barrier code was faulty because of a couple of
				potential race situations (fixed) and the
				infinite wait situation in the reaper thread.
		- UPDATE: original barrier() may have had a lost wakeup problem.

- segmentation faults from out-of-scope pointers and improperly initialized
	data structures (straightforward fixes).
