BUGS (Arthur) (11/27/2016):
---------------------------

- new bug in thread cleaner, causes failure to terminate
	- appears to be caused by calling terminate when there are no running threads
		- added a new check to avoid this problem, hopefully that's the only problem
	- KEEP THIS PART OF THE CODE ON ALERT FOR NEW ISSUES (difficult to effectively debug)
