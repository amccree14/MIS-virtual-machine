(all solved as of 9PM, 11/10/2016)


---------------------------
BUGS (Arthur) (11/10/2016):
---------------------------

	- program fails to parse more than one item from a string
		- notably, this is the case for VAR creation, unsure about others
	- program loops infinitely when parser sees \t\n\r escape codes in STRING



PARSE FAILURES:
	- VAR parse fails on STRING type when handing two parameters over
	- VAR parse fails on NUMERIC when there is no trailing comma on the value (eh)

	- anyway, in general there's something buggy going on




NOTE: create HALT command obj. Takes no parameters, does nothing, is simply appended to the very end
	of the commands vector, so that a LABEL created on the last line of the code will be valid
	(even if the label will be utterly useless)
